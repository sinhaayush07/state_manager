# State Manager
A simple light weight javaScript library for State Management.
## How to use

- Just clone or copy paste, totally your preference.
- replace values of state and mutations with your own.
- and you have a small store ready to be used anywhere.
- if you want to listen to a change in the value of a property in state, subscribe to the property name like store.events.subscribe(<'propertyName'>)
- if you want to change a property, write your desired mutation and use it via store.commit(<'propertyName'>, data)
